# Best Practices in Machine Learning

## The Big Picture

1. **Impact**: what will be the business value or impact of a good model? how would stakeholders be positively impacted and is there a convincing story? what is the business objective? (e.g. is it user satisfaction, accuracy, or something else). should I aim for just a model or an end-to-end solution?
   - have I identified all relevant stakeholders?
   - at what stage of the process should I involve each of the relevant stakeholders?
2. **Trust**: how will the model be validated and how will I convince stakeholders that the model can be trusted?
3. **Approach**:
   - what are the questions I am asking, and am I asking the right questions?
   - do I have the right approach? am I starting with a preconceived idea and just looking to find data that will support my case? am I p-hacking?
